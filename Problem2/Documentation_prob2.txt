i and j are the indexes of text and pattern respectively
if the text letter matches with pattern letter, to move on to the next letter incerease i and j by 1
else only incerease i and set j to 0 so that we go to the next letter of text and first letter of pattern
if j reaches end of pattern count increases by 1 and j is set to 0 to first letter of pattern
